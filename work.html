								<h1 class="major">Dungeon Project</h1>
								
								<h2 class="major">Design Process</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Dungeon/Dungeon01.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The first step in designing this level began in Photoshop. Using an online template, I mapped out the layout of my dungeon, making note of spots where potential areas of interest would go. 
									One of the more challenging aspects of mapping out this level was deciding where to place the locations of the puzzles I had created.
								</p>
								
								<h2 class="major">Modeling</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Dungeon/Dungeon02.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The next step was to block out the level. I used an asset pack called <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/simple-dungeons">Simple Dungeons</a>
								 to populate the area with props. To sell the unsettling atmosphere I was shooting for, I designed my level to suggest traces of dark magical cult activity. 
								</p>

								<h2 class="major">Lighting</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Dungeon/Dungeon03.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I took inspiration from traditional 3D dungeon crawler games for the vibe of this game. I used lighting here to naturally guide the player between the main points 
									of interest: the shrine, prison, and later the passage into the lava pit. I also created my own custom fog effect for this project to further enhance the lighting, 
									inreasing the atmosphere in the dungeon. 
								</p>

								<h2 class="major">Puzzles</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Dungeon/Dungeon05.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In addition to the lighting serving as a guide to the player, I wanted to ensure that the player had clear feedback when attempting puzzles. Visual and auditory clues
									were placed in the environment to assist the player towards the solution. Unlit candles are present in the cells, blood is splattered in a pattern on the shrine, and boards 
									creak the wrong way before breaking under the player. I also implemented an additional safety measure, having text popups also appear on-screen if the player becomes lost. 
								</p>
								<p>the puzzles were created using Unreal's blueprint system. For this project, using visual scripting helped tremendously in keeping track of mechanics as they were being developed.

								</p>

								<h2 class="major">The Result</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Dungeon/Dungeon04.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The finished product was very close to the original design, nailing the dark and creepy dungeon aesthetic. Lighting and color attracted playtesters to points of interest, and gave them clear indication that there was a puzzle
									in the area.

						<!-- Cyber-6 -->
							<article id="Cyber-6">
								<h1 class="major">Cyber-6</h1>
								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Cyber-6/screencap1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This was a capstone project created from January to June 2022. You play as Cyber-6, a cyborg assassin fresh off of his latest hit. Armed
									only with his thruster pack, Cyber-6 must shake off the swarm of police drones so that he can make it to extraction.  The game is set in a 
									futuristic cyberpunk city, where the player must navigate rooftops, dodging obstacles and missiles deployed by the police of this city. 
								</p>

								<h2 class="major">Responsibilities</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Cyber-6/screencap1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I was put on the design team for this project. I had the responsibility of creating 3D models for the procedural generation. I was also tasked with
									creating UI elements like the health bar, dash icons, logo, and score text. I was also involved in implementing post-processing effects to add lighting to the environment. 
								</p>
								<p>I also created a trailer for the game, which you can view <a href="https://youtu.be/Teq4BJHV2ZQ">here!</a> the game is set to be featured at this year's Indiecade, and will be 
									linked here on its official release. 
								</p>

								<h2 class="major">Challenges</h2>
								<p>During the development of this game, our team ran into some issues with balance and major changes in our design. Initially, our game was set to use more traditional endless runner mechanics, featuring 
									a three-lane fixed movement system. However, we found ourselves gravitating towards a more freeform movement system, unrestrained by lanes. 									
								</p>
								<p>This created a new set of issues, as we had to create new systems for spawning objects, and redesign obstacles around this new movement. Several movement options ended up cut from development as they no longer made sense 
									within the project.  
								</p>

                        <!-- Board Game -->
							<article id="BoardGame">
								<h1 class="major">Reach for the Sky</h1>
								<h2 class="major">Design Process</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Board Game/boardgame00.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The prompt for this game was a "race to the finish", with a restriction on using any vehicles as part of the design. 
									As a result, I planned to simulate the strenuous experience of scaling a mountain. 
								</p>

								<h2 class="major">Mechanics</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Board Game/boardgame01.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The core of the game's design was centered around creating tough challenges which would require smart management of resources for success.
									The game board consists of slots which are filled by a shuffled mountain deck, ensuring that each playthrough will be different. Much like 
									in actual mountain climbing, careful routing and anticipation are the keys to success. An additional layer of challenge can be found in the map's 
									cloud layer, which hides the cards on it until someone attempts to cross onto them. This layer also doubles as a catch-up mechanic for players falling behind.  
								</p>

								<h2 class="major">Movement</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Board Game/boardgame02.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Navigating the board was also designed to reflect the difficulty of scaling a mountain. Players can only carry up to four 
									movement coins which they spend to move about the map. Moving horizontally is only one coin, whereas vertical movement costs 3 coins. 
									In addition to this, the obstacles that are generated by the mountain deck can also be utilized by other players to sabotage their next move.
								</p>

								<h2 class="major">Visual Design</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Board Game/boardgame03.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>One of the more enjoyable parts of creating this board game was designing the cards and pieces. The iconography in the cards and the player pieces were 
									inspired by hazard signs which populate mountains in the real world. The goal of creating this visual design was to clearly communicate the 
									effects at a glance, much like the real world counterparts that these cards draw inspiration from.
								</p>
								
								<h2 class="major">The Result</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Board Game/boardgame04.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The final result is a game with  clear visuals and simple, easy to understand mechanics with enough space for long term strategy.</p>
								<p>One of the biggest challenges of designing this game came in the form of balancing. Each card was carefully considered under the context of
									the movement coins to ensure that it would be just impactful enough. At one point, I had considered making a third deck just for the cloud layer 
									to add another layer of difficulty. This ended up scrapped as I could not find a way to properly balance the cards, and I also did not want to 
									overcomplicate the game.
